# GitHub Repos workflow for Alfred

This is a custom workflow for the [Alfred app][alfred-app] that lets you search and open a GitHub repository via the GitHub Search API.

## Authentication

You'll need to authenticate with a personal access token that you can generate in the [GitHub developer settings page][personal-access-token] or by running the `gh-token` command in Alfred.

After you have copied your personal access token, run `gh-login <your-token>` to set your personal access token.

## Usage

Here's the list of available commands.

### Global Search: `gh <query>`

![gh hello-world](docs/gh-hello-world.png)

The example above will search for repositories with the string "hello-world" in their name. Internally this uses the [GitHub Search syntax][github-search], so you can use modifiers like:

![gh hello-world stars:>1000](docs/gh-hello-world-stars-1000.png)

This will search only in repositories that have more than 1000 stars.

> Please note that this command only searches in the repository name. This means that your query will be appended with the `in:name` modifier. So when you type in `hello-world`, the final search query sent will be: "hello-world in:name".

### Search your repositories: `repo [query]`

This command works the same as the previous one (`gh <query>`) but it limits the search to your own repositories.

> This includes repositories from your organizations as well.

### Search Pull Requests: `pr [query]`

This command searches within the Pull Requests that you're involved in.

If you want to limit the search to be under your organisations, please remove `PR_ALL_INVOLVE_ME` environment variable

### Open notifications: `gh-notifications`

This command just opens your [GitHub notification][notifications-page] page.

## Config Cache TTL

You can customise the TTL for the internal caches of Repos/Organisations/PullRequests by seting the following
environment variables. (all in seconds)

```
> CACHE_TTL_SEC_ORG  default: 86400
> CACHE_TTL_SEC_PR  default: 300
> CACHE_TTL_SEC_REPO default: 86400
```


## Configuring host for Enterprise

If you're using an Enterprise account, you can call the `gh-host <host>` command.
